# Next.js 15 Server Component Timeout with Large Datasets

This repository demonstrates a bug in Next.js 15 where server components can timeout when handling large datasets or performing complex computations. The issue stems from the blocking nature of server components; long-running operations can block the event loop, leading to timeouts.

## Bug Description

When a server component attempts to fetch or process a substantial amount of data, the request might exceed the default timeout limit set by the server.  This results in a timeout error, even if the underlying code is logically sound.

## Solution

The primary solution involves optimizing the data fetching and processing to be less resource-intensive or breaking down the task into smaller, asynchronous chunks.  Utilizing techniques like pagination, data streaming, or background processing can prevent timeouts and improve overall performance.
